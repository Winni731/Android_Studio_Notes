Two ways to create Layouts:
1. Using an XML file to declare the user interface ahead of time
2. Writing Kotlin / Java code to create the layout at runtime programmatically.

in class MainActivity extends AppCompatActivity
-->   setContentView(R.layout.activity_main); 
-->   set the layout to activity_main.xml file
